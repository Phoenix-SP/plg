  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nEvaluating process mining algorithms could require the availability of a suite of real-world business processes and their execution logs, which hardly are available.\r\n\r\nProcess Log Generator is a application capable to generate random business processes, starting from some general \"complexity paramenters\". PLG is also able to \"execute\" a given process model in order to generate a process log.\r\n\r\nThis software is designed to help researchers in the construction of a large set of processes and corresponding execution logs. This software is released with a small library which could help in the programmatical creation of processes.\r\n\r\n# Main Features\r\n\r\n* Random generation and simulation of complex process models;\r\n* Random generation and simulation of complex data objects;\r\n* Detailed tweaking of activities time features;\r\n* Random evolution of a process model, in order to generate a slightly different version of it (to simulate concept drifts);\r\n* Deep control on the generated simulation noise;\r\n* Event stream generation, and, while the stream is running, straightaway switch of the underlying simulated model, to simulate concept drifts;\r\n* Process model import from PLG2 or BPMN XML files (designed with Signavio);\r\n* Models export as BPMN 2.0 XML, BPMN/Petri net Graphviz Dot files, PNML and PLG2.\r\n\r\n# Screencast Demo\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/t-GMV4hU_vs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-GMV4hU_vs)\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n* Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/delas/plg/wiki) for all information.
