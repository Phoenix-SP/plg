# Processes and Logs Generator [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/delas/plg/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/delas/plg/latest)

Process Log Generator is a application capable to generate random business processes, starting from some general "complexity paramenters". PLG is also able to "execute" a given process model in order to generate a process log.

This software is designed to help researchers in the construction of a large set of processes and corresponding execution logs. This software is released with a small library which could help in the programmatical creation of processes.

**Attention:** this repository is a complete rewriting of the project already available at this link: http://www.processmining.it/sw/plg.

## Help
* How to specify [Data Objects](https://github.com/delas/plg/wiki/Data-Objects-Definition) to generate multiperspectives logs
* How to work with [times in PLG](https://github.com/delas/plg/wiki/Managing-Timestamps)
